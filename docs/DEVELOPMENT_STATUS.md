  - [ ] Staging environment
  - [ ] Production environment
  - [ ] CI/CD pipeline

- [ ] **Security hardening**:
  - [ ] Input validation
  - [ ] SQL injection prevention
  - [ ] XSS protection
  - [ ] Rate limiting

## ðŸŽ¯ IMMEDIATE NEXT STEPS

### Priority 1: Complete Database Foundation
1. **Fix database table creation script** - The `02_CreateTables.sql` is currently empty
2. Run all database scripts in order
3. Verify all tables, relationships, and constraints

### Priority 2: Complete Backend APIs
1. Implement EmployeeService with business logic
2. Complete EmployeesController with all endpoints
3. Create AffiliationsController and service
4. Add proper error handling and validation

### Priority 3: Complete Frontend Pages
1. Create Dashboard component
2. Complete Employee management pages
3. Add search and filtering capabilities
4. Implement CRUD operations for all entities

### Priority 4: Integration Testing
1. Test complete user workflows
2. Verify security and permissions
3. Performance testing
4. User acceptance testing

## ðŸ“‹ DEVELOPMENT CHECKLIST

### Backend Development
- [ ] Complete all service implementations
- [ ] Add comprehensive validation
- [ ] Implement audit logging
- [ ] Add caching where appropriate
- [ ] Create comprehensive API documentation
- [ ] Add health checks and monitoring

### Frontend Development
- [ ] Create all required pages and components

## ðŸ”§ KNOWN ISSUES TO ADDRESS

1. **Database schema incomplete** - Primary blocker
2. **Missing service implementations** - Core functionality
3. **Frontend routing needs completion** - Navigation
4. **Authentication flow needs testing** - Critical security
5. **Business rule validation incomplete** - Data integrity

## ðŸ“Š COMPLETION ESTIMATE

- **Database Layer**: 80% complete (need to fix table creation)
- **Backend APIs**: 30% complete (foundation done, need implementations)
- **Frontend UI**: 25% complete (structure done, need pages)
- **Integration**: 10% complete (setup done, need testing)
- **Overall Project**: ~35% complete

## ðŸš€ DEPLOYMENT READINESS

The application has a solid foundation but needs the above components completed before deployment. The architecture is sound and scalable, following best practices for enterprise applications.
